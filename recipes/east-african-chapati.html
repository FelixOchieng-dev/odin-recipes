    <h2><em><strong>Description</strong></em></h2>
    <p>Adopted from Indian cuisine, African bread known as chapati has been a part of East African cuisine for centuries. The East African recipe is slightly different from its Indian counterpart. This bread accompanies African soups and stews well.</p>
<p>Preparation is minimal, making this a great choice for cooks in a pinch.</p>
