<h2><em><strong>Description</strong></em>
    <p>This recipe for Irish coffee has been adapted from the one at the Foynes Flying Boat Museum in Ireland. According to legend, Chef Joe Sheridan worked at a restaurant in the Foynes airport when one planeload of passengers was forced to return to the terminal due to bad weather. Chef Sheridan was asked to make something warm for the stranded passengers, so he added some Irish whiskey to their coffee. When asked whether the tasty coffee was Brazilian, Chef Sheridan jokingly answered, "No, that was Irish coffee!" </p>

<h2><em><strong>Steps</strong></em>
<p><ol>
    <li>Put a small metal spoon in a footed, heatproof glass and fill it with boiling water. Let sit for 5 seconds and empty glass.</li>
    <li>Put 1 to 2 teaspoons of brown sugar* and a jigger (1.5 ounces) of Irish whiskey in warmed glass, then fill to about 1/2 inch from brim with very hot, strong black coffee. Stir well to melt sugar.</li>
    <li>Carefully pour lightly whipped cream over back of warmed spoon so that it floats on top of coffee. Do not stir â€” sip coffee through the cream.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>*Partially refined Demerara sugar is often used in Ireland, but turbinado or brown sugar works, too. </p></h2>
